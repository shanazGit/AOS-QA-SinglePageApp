# AOS-QA-SinglePageApp
This project is a single-page application developed as part of my Software Quality Assurance (QA) course. The primary focus was on testing and quality assurance, where I:
Wrote comprehensive test cases covering functionality, usability, and performance.
Identified and documented bugs in a detailed bug report for further analysis and debugging.
This repository serves as a showcase of my skills in testing and QA processes, with a focus on enhancing the reliability and quality of web applications.
